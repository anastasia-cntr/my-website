        About me
      </h2>
      <p className="text-center">
        My passion for web development came in a very unexpected period of my
        professional life. My initial plan was to pursue a degree in Psychology
        until I decided to make a change and deep dive into the world of
        programming. I fell in love with software development since the idea of
        having the power of building anything was right at my fingertips through
        coding. My favourite part of programming is the feeling of achievement
        after you find out a solution to a challenging problem. I am eager to
        learn new technologies. I am currently looking for a{" "}
        <b>full-time position</b> as a software developer.
      </p>
      <p className="text-center">
        When I'm not exploring the development <em>rabbit hole</em>, I enjoy
        playing video games with my friends, playing with my cat and watching
        movies.
